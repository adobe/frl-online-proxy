    "content": "The FRL Online Proxy is a simple solution for managing feature-restricted (FRL) Adobe licenses in an isolated network. It is a caching, terminating reverse proxy that facilitates license management for client machines that have restricted online access. Each OS user of each Adobe application that activates via FRL Online must be able, when launching the application for the first time, to connect to Adobe’s licensing servers. If another OS user requires use of that same application (or if the original OS user wants to use a second application), then that other OS user (or that other application) must also, on their first launch, be able to connect to Adobe’s licensing servers. This “first launch while connected” requirement presents a challenge for customers whose networks have limited or no access to the Internet. On such networks, it may be infeasible or even impossible for users to have network access to Adobe servers when launching their applications for the first time. The FRL Online Proxy solves this customer problem by brokering requests to the licensing service on behalf of any client machine on the network. A customer who wishes to keep his users or their machines from contacting the internet can let them connect on their local network to the FRL Online Proxy, and then allow the FRL Online proxy to contact Adobe servers. This is completely safe for the customer, because the proxy will not accept anything but license requests from clients, and those requests will only be sent to the Adobe servers. For customers who want to put their proxy on an internal network with is either intermittently connected or never connected to Adobe licensing servers, the proxy also supports license caching and store/forward relay capabilities. The license caching means that, if there are multiple users on a machine who use the same application, the proxy needs to connect to Adobe only for one of them, because the resulting activation will automatically be reused for other users on that machine. The store/forward capability means that, if a customer deploys the proxy on a fully isolated network, they can use an administrative process to collect the stored activation requests, send them to Adobe, and get the responses back to the internal proxy. That internal proxy will then use the cached responses to activate all the internal machines. ",

    "title": "Use Cases",
    "content": "Always-connected networks . If a proxy instance can always contact Adobe servers, then it can be run in passthrough mode where it passes through every received request to Adobe and returns the response directly to the client. This setup is typically used for security purposes, because it prevents users on the proxy’s LAN from having direct internet access while still allowing their applications to be licensed via FRL Online. The advantage of not turning on caching in this case is that the proxy uses no database resources and thus can be run forever with no administrative overhead. Intermittently-connected networks . If a proxy instance is on an intermittently-connected network, then it can be run in cache mode where it caches responses from Adobe while connected and then reuses them when offline. A proxy running in cache mode works similarly to one running in passthrough mode, but it always stores in the database the latest request it has received from each application on each machine, and whenever it receives a matching response to a request it stores that also. That way, after having run for a period of time connected, the proxy can successfully respond to all requests from machines on its local network, even if they come from OS users who have not previously activated their applications. If new machines or applications are deployed to a network while the network is offline, the proxy will not be able to activate those machines or applications, but it will remember the requests for activation in its database. Then, when the proxy regains connectivity to Adobe, an administrator can perform one run of the proxy in forward mode, which will cause it to get responses to all of the cached requests. That way, when the proxy is taken back offline, the new machine or applications whose requests were forwarded and whose responses were stored will be able to activate as expected. Because the proxy uses a file-based database when in cache mode, its machine must have enough disk space available to store one request/response pair for each application on each machine, where each pair is typically less than 10K bytes in size. In addition, as described above, proxies running in cache mode should be run once in forward mode whenever they have been offline while new machines or applications were deployed to their LAN. Fully-isolated networks . If a proxy is going to be used effectively on a fully isolated network, then a second proxy on a connected network is required so that the two can run as a “store-forward pair”, as follows: . | Let’s call the two proxy instances SI and FI (for storing instance and forwarding instance). Configure SI and FI so they both use databases that are called proxy-db.sqlite. Make sure the FI instance has access to Adobe servers over the network. | Run SI in store mode on a regular basis (using frl-proxy -m store). This will cause it to collect all requests that it cannot answer from its cache of responses, but because it’s on an isolated network it will not try to contact Adobe. | From time to time, stop SI for a moment. Collect all the unanswered requests it has accumulated by invoking frl-proxy export stored-requests.sqlite. (This exports any unanswered requests in proxy-db.sqlite to a new database stored-requests.sqlite.) Then restart the SI instance as usual with frl-proxy -m store. | Move the stored-requests.sqlite database file to the FI instance location and rename it frl-proxy.sqlite so it’s the database used by FI. | Forward all the stored requests to Adobe by invoking FI with frl-proxy -m forward. This will complete quickly, sending all the stored requests in the frl-proxy.sqlite database to Adobe servers and storing the responses in the same database. | When the forwarding has completed, move the frl-proxy.sqlite database from the FI machine to the SI machine and rename it forwarded-requests.sqlite. | Stop the SI instance for a moment. Import the database of forwarded responses into the SI instance by invoking frl-proxy import forwarded-requests.sqlite. This will move all the received responses into the proxy-db.sqlite file. Restart the SI instance as usual with frl-proxy -m store. | . At this point all the forward response will be available to the storing instance, so any apps whose requests had been stored will be successfully activated when they are next launched. See cache management for more information on the proxy export and import commands. Isolated machines . There is a variant of the store-forward architecture described above that can be used to pre-activate all the applications on an isolated machine. In this use case, we have one or more machines that are being set up for use on an isolated network, but during the setup process they have access to the network. In this case, the procedure is as follows: . | In addition to installing the applications and (proxy) licenses on the isolated machines, each isolated machine also gets configured with its own instance of the FRL Proxy (using a trusted certificate for localhost) that is configured to run in store mode as a service. | While the machines are connected to the network, an administrator runs the proxy in cache mode and launches each of the applications that are to be activated. | Then the machines are put in their isolated locations. | . Because activating the applications in cache mode will cache the initial activation responses in the database, each machine’s proxy (now running in store mode) will be able to activate the application even when they are launched for the first time by other OS users on the isolated machines.

SSL mode requires an X.509 SSL certificate and password. The certificate file should be secured with limited file permissions so that only the account running the proxy can read it. The password can be stored in plain text in the configuration file or in the environment variable FRL_PROXY_SSL.CERT_PASSWORD. If you store your password in the configuration, be sure to limit access to that file. The SSL certificate must be trusted by the client machines that contact the proxy, but it need not be a publicly-signed certificate (that is, it can be a self-signed certificate that is installed on the client machines and marked as trusted). For testing, you may wish to use a free, short-lived, renewable, publicly-signed certificate obtained from Let’s Encrypt.

Replace [user] and [group] with the user and group of the non-privileged account. | sudo chown [user]:[group] /etc/frl-proxy/proxy-conf.toml | sudo chown -R [user]:[group] /var/log/frl-proxy | . | Create the service configuration file /etc/systemd/system/frl-proxy.service and open it in a text editor | Copy this example configuration to the editor. Be sure to change the paths to the proxy binary and config file if necessary. And replace [user] with the name of the account that will run the proxy.

With the service config in place, the service can be controlled with systemctl. Here are some examples of how to manage the service. # Enable/disable determines if the service will start on boot sudo systemctl enable frl-proxy sudo systemctl disable frl-proxy # Start/stop will manually start and stop the service, restart will stop and then start it sudo systemctl start frl-proxy sudo systemctl stop frl-proxy sudo systemctl restart frl-proxy # If any changes are made to the frl-proxy.service config, the systemd daemon must be reloaded sudo systemctl daemon-reload .
