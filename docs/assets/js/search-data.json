    "content": "The FRL Online Proxy is a simple solution for managing feature-restricted Adobe licenses in an isolated network. It is a terminating reverse proxy that facilitates license management for client machines that have restricted online access. FRL-Online licenses must, at a minimum, connect to Adobe’s licensing service once to activate a license, and again to deactivate the license. This presents a challenge for networks that have limited or no access to the Internet. On isolated networks, it may be infeasible or even impossible to facilitate access to Adobe’s licensing servers. FRL Online Proxy solves this problem by brokering requests to the licensing service on behalf of any client on the network. ",

Consult your organization’s network security team if you need to use an organization certificate. Free cerftificates can be obtained from Let’s Encrypt. SSL can be enabled by setting the command-line option --ssl true and setting the paths to the private key and certificate file with --ssl-key and --ssl-cert respectively. Example: . $ ./frl-proxy --ssl true --ssl-cert /path/to/cert.pem --ssl-key /path/to/key.pem . This will start the proxy with SSL (https) enabled, listening on the default https host/port, https://127.0.0.1:3030.
