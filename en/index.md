# Overview

The FRL Online Proxy is a simple solution for managing feature-restricted Adobe licenses in an isolated network.

FRL Online Licenses must, at a minimum, connect to Adobe's licensing service once to activate a license, and again to deactivate the license.
This presents a challenge for networks that have limited or no access to the Internet. On isolated networks, it may be infeasible or even
impossible to facilitate access to Adobe's licensing servers.

FRL Online Proxy solves this problem by brokering requests to the licensing service on behalf of any client on the network.
